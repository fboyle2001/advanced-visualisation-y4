# Advanced Visualisation Coursework
Submitted by chpf93

## Problem 1
To run problem 1:
1. Place the Moon data from Blackboard into the ./problem1/data folder (so there should be ./problem1/data/colour and ./problem1/data/displacement)
2. Create a new Python 3.11.1 virtual environment and install the requirements.txt that is in the same directory as this readme
3. Run problem1.py, after a few seconds a browser window should open with the interactive visualisation
Full source code is included in the problem1 folder

## Problem 2
To run problem 2:
1. Place the Moon data from Blackboard into the ./problem2/build/moon folder alongside the data that is already included (the .png files) (so there should be ./problem2/build/moon/colour, ./problem2/build/moon/displacement and ./problem2/build/moon/pygmt)
2. Run problem2.py (it shouldn't require any additional packages), after a few seconds a browser window should open with the interactive visualisation

Please note that the full source code for this problem is in the ./problem2/code directory and the bundled/compiled version is in the ./problem2/build directory
If you wish to run the source code directly, enter the ./problem2/code folder and run 'npm install' followed by 'npm start' (the Moon data will need to be placed in the ./problem2/code/public folder in this case as well).
